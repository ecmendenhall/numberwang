# The rules:
# All multiples of 3 are numberwang.
# All multiples of 5 are numberwang.
# Multiples of 3 and 5 are wangernumb.

# The goal:
# If a number is numberwang, print "that's numberwang!"
# If a number is wangernumb, print "that's wangernumb!"
# If a number is neither, print "not numberwang."
# If called without arguments, print all the numbers
# from 1 to 15 in order.

# Some helpful commands:
#   - The 'expr' command evaluates arithmetic expressions:
#
#     $ expr 1 + 2
#     3
#
#   - Try it inside backticks in tests:
#     $ if [ `expr 1 + 1` eq 2]; then echo "math still works"; fi
#     math still works
#
#   - The seq command generates a sequence:
#     $ seq 1 3
#     1
#     2
#     3
